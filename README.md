# Prompt
Using ChatGPT and persona prompt style to create a simple Pytorch application that a user can implement with zero coding experience. The genesis of the project was to take a complex tool such as Pytorch (a machine learning based language ), and using Prompt Engineering and Openai/ChatGPT provide an easy guide and explanation with immediate usability. 

Prompt Engineering is the idea of training an AI model from inputs to produce certain desired outputs. (Taken from Prompt Engineering for AI, Coursera). 

Machine is still in its infancy, usually requrining multiple years of studying and advanced degrees in order to contribute at the macro/ company or research level. I wanted to take Pytorch the easiest to use machine learning and perform tasks with. Pytorch is more of a scripting style language which is more familiar to the average person using a keyboard instead of Keras, Tensorflow and even ONNX.

# Prompt
Using ChatGPT and persona prompt style to create a simple Pytorch application that a user can implement with zero coding experience. The genesis of the project was to take a tool extremely complex, machine learning based language and using Prompt Engineering and Openai/ChatGPT provide an easy guide and explanation. Prompt Engineering is the idea of training an AI model from inputs to produce certain desired outputs. 

Pytorch is a machine learning based language and the easiest to use and perform tasks with instead of Keras, Tensorflow and even ONNX as Pytorch is more of a scripting style language.
